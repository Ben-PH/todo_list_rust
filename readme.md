##### Install
Run the following code to install the package as a binary

```bash
cargo install todo_list
```

##### Clone and check it out

Make sure you have Cargo installed, if you install the rust package, I think it should come with it. Mine did (on Manjaro system btw).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alalfakawma/todo_list_rust.git
```

```bash
cd todo_list_rust/
```

```bash
cargo run
```
